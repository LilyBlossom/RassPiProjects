# RassPiProjects

# In this repository I will include projects that I am working on with the Raspberry Pi.
# This well include instructions on how to setup a pi to do a task and files that contain code to get a pi to do something with HATs.
# I will probably include more to this readme when i figure out what to put here. I'm still new to Github. (9 April, 2015)
